== Description ==

Grid Gallery helps you showcase your images in a clean, organized grid layout. Unlike traditional lightbox galleries, this one presents images in a slider-style preview while keeping the familiar gallery appearance. It's a fresh approach that works well for photographers, artists, and anyone who wants their images to stand out.

= Why Choose Grid Gallery? =

When visitors click on a thumbnail, the image opens smoothly within the gallery area – no popup windows or separate lightbox overlays. This keeps users engaged on your page while they browse through your photos.
